# diabetes-analysis

Dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008
Inspiration from https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/analysis-healthcare-data-using-sql-kristopher-bosch/

diabetes-analysis uses a dataset with information for patients with diabetes such as race, gender, age, number of lab procedures, and number of medicines. Based off of the link for inspiration above, I went through and performed analysis to answer possible questions someone might have about this dataset. SQL techniques such as aggregations, window functions, and CTEs.
